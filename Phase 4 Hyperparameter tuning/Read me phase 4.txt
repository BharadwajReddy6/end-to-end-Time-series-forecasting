# Hyperparameter Tuning for LSTM and Transformer

This phase focuses on optimizing the LSTM and Transformer deep learning models using both Grid Search and Bayesian Optimization techniques.

---

# 1️⃣ LSTM Hyperparameter Tuning (Phase5_LSTM_HyperparameterTuning.py)

- Built an LSTM model with:
  - Tuneable units
  - Dropout rates
  - Learning rates
- Applied Random Search and Bayesian Optimization separately.
- Saved the best models based on validation loss.

---

# 2️⃣ Transformer Hyperparameter Tuning (Phase5_Transformer_HyperparameterTuning.py)

- Built a Transformer model with:
  - Tuneable dense units
  - Number of heads
  - Key dimension
  - Learning rates
- Applied Random Search and Bayesian Optimization separately.
