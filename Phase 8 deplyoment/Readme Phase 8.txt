# Deployment Preparation

This phase finalizes the machine learning models, preprocessing steps, and artifacts for production deployment.

---

# Actions:

1. Saved the StandardScaler object (scaler.pkl).
2. Trained final XGBoost classifier model and saved (xgboost_final_model.json).
3. Trained final LSTM forecasting model and saved (lstm_final_model.h5).

---

# Why important?

- Saved Scaler ensures the new input data is normalized same as training data.
- Saved Models allow API servers (like Flask/FastAPI) to load and make predictions immediately.
- Versioning ensures reproducibility and traceability.

---

# âœ… Summary:

The project is now production-ready with all trained artifacts stored safely.

Ready to deploy on:
- Flask or FastAPI servers
- Docker containers
- Vertex AI or any cloud platform
