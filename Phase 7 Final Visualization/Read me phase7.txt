#Final Visualizations

This phase summarizes the final evaluation of models through clean visualizations:

---

# 1️⃣ Confusion Matrix

- Heatmap showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- Helps visualize model classification performance.

---

# 2️⃣ ROC Curve

- Plots True Positive Rate vs False Positive Rate.
- Area Under Curve (AUC) indicates model's ability to distinguish between classes.

---

# 3️⃣ Forecast Comparison

- Line plot showing predicted vs true values from:
  - ARIMA
  - SARIMA
  - LSTM
  - Transformer
  - XGBoost
- Helps compare performance visually across different forecasting techniques.

# ✅ Summary:

These visualizations allow a final clear comparison and demonstrate model effectiveness in detecting anomalies and forecasting sensor behaviors.
